# Intrinsic Alignments

This is a project to measure and model the intrinsic alignments of galaxies in both observations and simulations.


## Requirements

This project requires the following Python packages be installed:

* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org)
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org)
* [astropy](http://www.astropy.org)
* [halotools](https://halotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [rotations](https://github.com/duncandc/rotations)
* [watson_distribution](https://github.com/duncandc/watson_distribution)

Alignment correlation functions are in development in my personal halotools fork in a dedicated [branch](https://github.com/duncandc/halotools/tree/alignments_devel).  In addition to myself, this branch has contributions by:

* Patricia Larson
* Andrew Hearin
* Simon Samuroff


## Simulation Products


### Hydrodynics Simualtions

This propject uses the results of an independent repository, [Illustris_Shapes](https://github.com/duncandc/Illustris_Shapes), for simulated galaxy/halo shapes and orientation catalogs.

### Dark Matter Only Simulations

In addition to the Illustris DMO simulations, this project uses the dark matter only simualtions:

*  Bolshoi Planck

Thes halo catalogs for these simulations are available through Halotools, described [here](https://halotools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart_and_tutorials/quickstart_guides/working_with_halotools_provided_catalogs.html).
