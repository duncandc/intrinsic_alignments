# Literature IA Models

A collection of models from the literature relavent for modelling instrinsic alignments.


## Misalignment Models

Models for galaxy-halo misalignments can be found in `literature_ia_model_components.py`.  Currently this includes:

* [Bett (2012)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.3717)
* [Knebe et al. (2008)](https://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1917)
* [Okumura et al. (2009)](https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.3790)

See `literature_models_demo.ipynb` for an demonstration of the misalignment angle distributions in these models.  These models are explored in some detail in [Joachimi et al. (2012)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5791).


## Correlation Function Models

* HRH model
* HRH* model

These models can be found in `hrh_model.py`.


## (N)LA Models

Work in progress...
